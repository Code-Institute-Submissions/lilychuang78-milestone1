# Resume Website

https://lilychuang78.github.io/milestone1/ <br />
This website is built to be a resume for potential clients and recruiters.
The easy to understand navigation menu guide the users to different pages including including "Home", "Career", "Skills", "Education" and "Contact".
On the homepage, there is a brief introduction about myself.
The website is responsive on desktop and smaller devices such as pad and smartphone.<br />
At the moment, the form in "Contact" page is not functional as it is not connected to the backend dataset.
<br />

## UX
### Scope Plane:
1. what they say they need: a resume website
2. what they actually need: a responsive website with different devices
3. what they don't know they need: also a CV that can be downloaded
### Skeleton Plane:
The skeleton plane was created using Balsamiq Wireframes.

### Strategy Plan:
1. what does the user expect? information of working experience, education, and importantly skills
2. who are the users? potential recruiters or clients
3. does it offer what users want? content of web-design and programming itself, with future portfolios and contact information
### Structure Plane:
The homepage leads to 'Career', 'Skills', 'Education', 'Contact' and 'Download' which opens a bank window.
The navigation bar is always presented on the top of the screen so the users is able to navigate to other webpages.

## Testing
The functionality and visiual display of the website were tested with both Bracket and Github locally and Google Chrome developer tools.<br />
Both desktop responsive view and smartphone view including Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel2, Pixel2 XL, iPhone5/SE, iPhone6/7/8, iPhone6/7/8 Plus, iPhoneX, iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Duo, and Galaxy Fold were examined. 
The code was reformatted and checked using Freeformater.com's formatter and validator.
## Deployment
Website was coded using Gitpod and uploaded to Github using git command.
Commands including "git add ." to add the files, "git commit -m 'message'" to stage, and "git push" to deploy on Github. In the settings option, I selected the master branch to publish online.
