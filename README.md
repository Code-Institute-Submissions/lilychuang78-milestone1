# milestone1
https://github.com/lilychuang78/milestone1

The Aim:
This project is to build a personal protfolio website for potential recruiters.
The website includes a navigation of home page, work experiences, skills, contact form, project (links), and download (cv).

Development Tools:
Github
Gitpod
Balsamiq Wireframes
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap
Google Chrome developer tools

Future Functionality:
At the moment, contact form is not used as it is not connected to the backend dataset.
Project should be linked to the protfolios (further milestone projects) in the future.


User Design Experience:
>Scope Plane:
	what they say they need: a resume website, social media profile
	what they actually need: a responsive website with different devices, links to social media profile
	what they don't know they need: links to the future protfolio/projects, a CV that can be downloaded
	
>Skeleton Plane:
#put basamique here
	#mobile
	#desktop

>Strategy Plan:
	what does the user expect? information of working experience, education, and importantly skills
	who are the users? potential recruiters or clients
	does it offer what users want? content of web-design and programming itself, with future portfolios and contact information

>Structure Plane
	The CV website will be in the same page, which contains a menu of 'Home', 'Career' (including skills), 'Education', 'Download', 'Portfolio' and 'Contact'.
	By clicking 'Home', 'Career', 'Education' and 'Contact' in the navigation bar, the webpage will scroll down to the correspodent sections.
	'Download' and 'Portfolio' in navigation bar will be open a bank window.
	'Contact' at the footer includes email address and links to the social media.
	(Future development: contact form connecting to backend)
