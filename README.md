The Aim:
This project is to build a personal protfolio website for potential recruiters.
The website includes a navigation of home page, work experiences, skills, contact form, project (links), and download (cv).

Development Tools:
Github
Gitpod
Balsamiq Wireframes
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap
Google Chrome developer tools

Future Functionality:
At the moment, contact form is not used as it is not connected to the backend dataset.
Project should be linked to the protfolios (further milestone projects) in the future.
