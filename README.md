**Future Functionality:**<br />

**User Design Experience:**<br />
>**Scope Plane:**<br />
	1. what they say they need:<br /> a resume website, social media profile<br />
	2. what they actually need:<br /> a responsive website with different devices, links to social media profile<br />
	3. what they don't know they need:<br /> links to the future protfolio/projects, a CV that can be downloaded<br /><br />

    <br />
>**Strategy Plan:**<br />
	1. what does the user expect?<br />information of working experience, education, and importantly skills<br />
	2. who are the users?<br />potential recruiters or clients<br />
	3. does it offer what users want?<br />content of web-design and programming itself, with future portfolios and contact information<br /><br />
>**Structure Plane:**<br />
	The homepage leads to 'Career', 'Skills', 'Education', and 'Contact' pages and 'Download' and 'Portfolio' opens a bank window.<br />
	The navigation bar is always presented on the top of the screen so the users is able to navigate to other webpages.<br />
	(Future development: contact form connecting to backend)
